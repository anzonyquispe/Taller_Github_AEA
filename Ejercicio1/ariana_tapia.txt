Paradise-BTS
Marathon Marathon
Life is long and slow
42.195
There is a dream paradise at the end

But the real world
Unlike a promise
We have to run
When you shoot the signal
You have no destination
There is no landscape
When the chest overflows
You need to

It's okay to stop
You do not have to run without knowing why
It's fine without a dream
If you have moments of happiness for a while
It's okay to stop
I do not run without knowing my purpose
It's fine without a dream
All your breathing is already in paradise

We make dreams from others (like debt)
Be taught to be great (like light)
Your dream. In fact load
If only the future is a dream
What did I do last night in bed?
Even if the name of the dream is different, it's okay
Buying a laptop next month
Or just eating
I do not have cancer, but I have a lot of money
Dreams are big
Just be someone
We deserve a life
What's big and small is just you

But the real world
Unlike a promise
We have to run
When you shoot the signal
You have no destination
There is no landscape
When the chest overflows
You need to

It's okay to stop
You do not have to run without knowing why
It's fine without a dream
If you have moments of happiness for a while
It's okay to stop
I do not run without knowing my purpose
It's fine without a dream
All your breathing is already in paradise

I dont have a dream
Dreaming is sometimes scary
I just live like this
This is a small dream for me to survive
Dreaming is a dream
Breathe sometimes
Someone like to live like that
The world is insulting me

Yeah
The world is not qualified to blaspheme
What is Dreaming
Because I never taught him
I dreamed of dreaming so I could sleep with tears
I wake up from a nightmare to you
Let's smile every day now in that paradise

It's okay to stop
I do not run without knowing my purpose
It's fine without a dream
All your breathing is already in paradise

Stop runnin 'for nothin' my friend
Now finish the stupid race
Stop runnin 'for nothin' my friend
All your breathing is already in paradise

Stop runnin 'for nothin' my friend
You do not have to have all your dreams
Stop runnin 'for nothin' my friend
All the languages ​​that make up you are already in paradise

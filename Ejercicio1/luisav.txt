Foushe√© - i'm fine 

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
I am fine
I swear, I don't mind
Sticks and stones to curb my appetite
I'll let it slide for the hundredth time
I'm fine
I'm fine
Fine (yeah, I'm, yeah, I'm)
Really, I'm fine (fine, I swear)
Bed of roses, my life is golden
This fat wallet I'm holding, my head on my shoulders
Fool me once and that's your fault (ooh-ooh)
Fool my twice and you're gone (ooh-ooh)
Mama says I'm a sweetheart (ooh-ooh)
Grandma says, "Keep your head up, it's fine"
Fine (ooh-ooh), I'm fine (ooh-ooh)
Really, I'm fine (ooh-ooh)
Promise I'm fine (ooh-ooh)
Fine

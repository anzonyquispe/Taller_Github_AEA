Not Safe - Gable Pice and Friends

Seated in the heavenlies
In the holy, holy, worthy, worthies
Feasting on the air you breathe
Floating on an eagles wing
I’m ruined for eternal things
So beautiful and terrifying
Glorious and petrifying
He’s a good God, but good god, He is not safe
He’s a good good God, but good god, He is not safe
You’re a good God, but good god, You are not safe
You’re a good good God, but good god, You are not safe
I’m saying controversial things
Just to watch you move me
When you said that you had died with me
Did you mean those words honestly
Seated in the heavenlies
Captive to the song you sing
Created by the breath you breathe
He’s a good God, but good god, He is not safe
He’s a good good God, but good god, He is not safe
You’re a good God, but good god, You are not safe
You’re a good good God, but good god, You are not safe
So down here as in the heavenlies
The King shall be our remedy
He’s good, He’s wild, He’s anything but tame
So down here as in the heavenlies
The King shall write our melody
He’s good, He’s wild, He’s anything but tame
So down here as in the heavenlies
The King shall be the remedy
He’s good, He’s wild, He’s anything but tame
So down here as in the heavenlies
The King shall write our melody
He’s good, He’s wild, He’s anything but tame
He’s a good God, but good god, He is not safe
He’s a good good God, but good god, He is not safe
You’re a good God, but good god, You are not safe
You’re a good good God, but good god, You are not safe

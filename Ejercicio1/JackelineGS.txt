Scary cat

I think I'm scared of all the signs
Don't ever leave me alone at night
I think I'm scared (I think I'm scared)
I don't know why (I don't know why)
Just leave the lights on and close the blinds
Because I'm a scaredy-cat
(Please) no more heart attacks
Because I'm a scaredy-cat
(Please) no more heart attacks
I think I'm scared
I have no time (he has no time)
I scream out loud just to see if I'm alive
I think I'm scared
I don't know why (I don't know why)
So leave the lights on
I'll stay inside
Because I'm a scaredy-cat
(Please) no more heart attacks
Because I'm a scaredy-cat
(Please) no more heart attacks
Dial 911
I'm calling from under my bed (under my bed)
It's hard to breath when you're not there (you're not there)
I find everything a nightmare (a nightmare)
Sometimes I know you don't care
But I feel like I'm disappearing in a hole
And nobody will know (know)
Nobody will go (except when I'm with you)
Sitting in my room alone
And nobody will know (know)
Nobody will go (except when I'm with you)
Why does no one understand
When I say I am just afraid?
Why does no one lend a hand
When I say I will drift away?
And there are clouds in disguise (I know)
And I'm always terrified
They might just rain on me
I'm losing my mind (I know)
But I think I'll be alright
Just hold my hands you'll see
I'm a scaredy-cat
(Please) no more heart attacks
I'm a scaredy-cat
(Please) no more heart attacks
I know that you think
I'm a scaredy-cat
(Please) no more heart attacks
I'm a scaredy-cat
(Please) no more heart attacks

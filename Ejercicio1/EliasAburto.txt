Senza Una Donna - Zucchero & Paul Young 

I change the world
I change the world
I change the world
I wanna change the world

This ain't the way
I spend my mornings, baby
Come stay?
You've been with him
And you come back, my lady
What's he like?

I just sit and watch the ocean
By myself, even I do my own cookin'
You can laugh, you're forgiven, but
I'm no longer frightened, to be livin'

Senza una donna
No more pain and no sorrow
Senza una donna
I'll make it through tomorrow
Senza una donna
Givin' me torture and bliss
Without a woman, better like this

There is no way
That you can buy me, baby
Don't make fun
You got to dig, a little deeper, lady
(In the heart?)

Yeah, if you have one
Here's my heart, feel the power
Look at me (look at me), I'm a flower
You can laugh, you're forgiven, but
I'm no longer frightened, to be livin'

Senza una donna
No more pain and no sorrow
Senza una donna
I'll make it through tomorrow
Senza una donna
Givin' me torture and bliss

I stay here, watch the ocean
Don't know why (don't know why)
I keep on talkin' (I keep on talkin')
You may laugh, you're forgiven, but
I'm no longer frightened (maybe)
To be livin'

Senza una donna
No more pain and no sorrow
Senza una donna
I'll make it through tomorrow
Senza una donna
Givin' me torture and bliss
Without a woman
Vieni qui!
Come on in!

Senza una donna
I don't know what might follow
Senza una donna
Ah, oh, maybe from tomorrow!
Senza una bonna
Givin' me torture and bliss

Out Of Hiding (Father's Song)

Come out of hiding, You're safe here with Me
There's no need to cover what I already see
You've got your reasons, but I hold your peace
You've been on lockdown, and I hold the key

'Cause I loved you before you knew what was love
I saw it all, still I chose the cross
You were the one that I was thinking of
When I rose from the grave
Now rid of the shackles, My victory is yours
I tore the veil for you to come close
There's no reason to stand at a distance anymore
You're not far from home

And I'll be your lighthouse when you're lost at sea
I will illuminate everything
No need to be frightened by intimacy
No, just throw off your fear and come running to Me

Oh, 'cause I loved you before you knew what was love
I saw it all, still I chose the cross
And you were the one that I was thinking of
When I rose from the grave
Now rid of the shackles, My victory is yours
I tore the veil for you to come close
There's no reason to stand at a distance anymore
You're not far from home

You're not far from home, no
Keep on coming

And oh as you run, what hindered love
Will only become part of the story?
And oh as you run, what hindered love
Will only become part of the story?
And oh as you run, what hindered love
Will only become part of the story?
And oh as you run, what hindered love
Will only become part of the story?

Baby, you're almost home now
Please don't quit now
You're almost home to Me
Baby, you're almost home now
Please don't quit now
You're almost home to Me (yes, you are)
Now baby, you're almost home now
Please don't quit now
You're almost home to Me
